# 🧑‍🏫 Real-Time Whiteboard Sharing App

This project is a part of a series where we build a real-time collaborative **whiteboard sharing application**. The app allows multiple users to join a shared whiteboard space where the host can draw, and all changes are reflected in real time for all participants.

This trailer demonstrates all the features you'll find in the final application.
